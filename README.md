# 30-Days-Python-Challenge
Type Tracking my Python learning journey based on my roadmap

## 📅 Day 1 – Python Environment, Core Concepts & Exploration

✅ Installed Python and verified version using terminal  
✅ Explored Python execution flow and interpreter behavior  
✅ Understood real-world applications of Python (Automation, Web, AI, Data)  
✅ Created GitHub repository to document learning journey  

🔍 Core Concepts Explored:
✔️ Variables and dynamic typing  
✔️ Numeric operations and expressions  
✔️ String formatting and concatenation  
✔️ User input handling  
✔️ Error understanding (TypeError, ValueError)  

🧪 Practice Experiments:

# Arithmetic & Variables
a = 12
b = 7
print("Sum:", a + b)
print("Difference:", a - b)
print("Product:", a * b)
print("Division:", a / b)

# User Interaction
name = input("Enter your name: ")
age = int(input("Enter your age: "))
print(f"Hello {name}, you will be {age + 1} next year.")

# Logical Thinking
x = 10
y = 20
print("Is x greater than y?", x > y)

🧠 Problem-Solving Tasks:
✔️ Converted user input into integers  
✔️ Predicted output before execution  
✔️ Fixed runtime errors by understanding data types  
✔️ Practiced clean and readable code  

📌 Key Takeaways:
• Python is interpreted and dynamically typed  
• Input is always read as string and must be converted  
• Small programs help understand larger logic  
• Errors are learning tools, not failures  

🎯 Objective:
Move beyond basic examples and build logical thinking from Day-1 itself.74


📅 Day 2 – Python Basics with Logic Practice

✅ Learned Python data types (int, float, string, boolean)  
✅ Understood variables and naming rules  
✅ Practiced taking input from user and converting data types  
✅ Explored operators (arithmetic, comparison, assignment)  

🧪 Practice Programs:
✔️ Checked even or odd number  
✔️ Compared two numbers and printed the greater one  
✔️ Calculated simple interest using user input  
✔️ Converted Celsius to Fahrenheit  

Example practice:
num = int(input("Enter a number: "))
if num % 2 == 0:
    print("Even number")
else:
    print("Odd number")

c = float(input("Enter temperature in Celsius: "))
f = (c * 9/5) + 32
print("Fahrenheit:", f)

🧠 What I Learned:
✔️ How conditions work using if-else  
✔️ Importance of type conversion (int(), float())  
✔️ Writing logic instead of memorizing code  
✔️ Debugging small mistakes by reading errors  

🎯 Goal:
Improve logical thinking and confidence by solving simple real-world problems using Python.
