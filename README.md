# 30-Days-Python-Challenge
Type Tracking my Python learning journey based on my roadmap

## 📅 Day 1 – Python Environment, Core Concepts & Exploration

✅ Installed Python and verified version using terminal  
✅ Explored Python execution flow and interpreter behavior  
✅ Understood real-world applications of Python (Automation, Web, AI, Data)  
✅ Created GitHub repository to document learning journey  

🔍 Core Concepts Explored:
✔️ Variables and dynamic typing  
✔️ Numeric operations and expressions  
✔️ String formatting and concatenation  
✔️ User input handling  
✔️ Error understanding (TypeError, ValueError)  

🧪 Practice Experiments:

# Arithmetic & Variables
a = 12
b = 7
print("Sum:", a + b)
print("Difference:", a - b)
print("Product:", a * b)
print("Division:", a / b)

# User Interaction
name = input("Enter your name: ")
age = int(input("Enter your age: "))
print(f"Hello {name}, you will be {age + 1} next year.")

# Logical Thinking
x = 10
y = 20
print("Is x greater than y?", x > y)

🧠 Problem-Solving Tasks:
✔️ Converted user input into integers  
✔️ Predicted output before execution  
✔️ Fixed runtime errors by understanding data types  
✔️ Practiced clean and readable code  

📌 Key Takeaways:
• Python is interpreted and dynamically typed  
• Input is always read as string and must be converted  
• Small programs help understand larger logic  
• Errors are learning tools, not failures  

🎯 Objective:
Move beyond basic examples and build logical thinking from Day-1 itself.
